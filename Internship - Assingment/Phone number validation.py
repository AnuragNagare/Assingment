#While it is possible to perform phone number validation on the front-end using JavaScript, 
#it is generally recommended to perform phone number validation on the backend, 
#as the front-end validation can be bypassed by a user with malicious intent.

#In Django, you can perform phone number validation on the backend by defining a custom form field that validates the phone number

from django import forms
from django.core.validators import RegexValidator

class PhoneNumberField(forms.CharField):
    default_error_messages = {
        'invalid': 'Enter a valid phone number',
    }

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.validators.append(RegexValidator(
            r'^\+?[0-9]+$',
            self.error_messages['invalid'],
            'invalid'
        ))

#we define a custom PhoneNumberField that inherits from CharField, 
#and adds a regular expression validator to check that the phone number contains only digits and an optional leading plus sign. 
#This regex is just a basic example, and you may want to use a more complex regex or additional validators depending on your specific requirements.

#You can then use this custom field in your form definition like any other field:

from django import forms

class MyForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    email = forms.EmailField()
    dob = forms.DateField()
    phone = PhoneNumberField()

#Now when the form is submitted, Django will perform server-side validation on the phone number field to ensure that it is valid according to the defined regular expression. 
# If the phone number is not valid, 
# the form will not be submitted and an error message will be displayed to the user.
